# Model capabilities reference (for choosing focus areas)
#
# Model Strengths (from empirical testing):
#
# GPT-5.2 Max:
#   - Best: Security analysis, correctness, actionable recommendations
#   - Use for: Primary reviewer on all changes
#
# Gemini:
#   - Best: Architecture insights, SPOF detection, concise unique findings
#   - Use for: System design, complex changes
#
# Grok 4.1:
#   - Best: Comprehensive breadth, operational concerns, edge cases
#   - Use for: Critical tier, operations-heavy code
#
# Codex:
#   - Best: Code correctness, performance, pragmatic suggestions
#   - Use for: Implementation-focused reviews
#
# Claude (self):
#   - Best: Edge cases, UX, full context awareness
#   - Use for: Always (has conversation context)
