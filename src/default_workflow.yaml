name: "General Development Workflow"
version: "2.1"
description: "A general-purpose 5-phase workflow for software development tasks. Works with any project type (Node.js, Python, etc.). Default to using Claude Code for implementation unless task is trivial."

# =============================================================================
# SETUP REQUIREMENTS
# =============================================================================
# Before starting this workflow, ensure:
# 1. Claude Code CLI is installed: npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
# 2. Required environment variables are set (check with: env | grep -i api_key)
# 3. Project dependencies are installed
#
# Available secrets (check your environment):
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Required for Claude Code and Claude API calls
# - OPENAI_API_KEY: For multi-model reviews (use latest generation available)
# =============================================================================

settings:
  # Configurable settings - override these per-project
  # Test command - defaults to build check
  # Override with actual test command: "npm test", "pytest", "go test ./...", etc.
  test_command: "npm run build"
  
  # Build/compile command (optional, for compiled languages)
  build_command: "npm run build"
  
  # Lint command (optional)
  lint_command: "npm run lint"
  
  # Documentation directory
  docs_dir: "docs"
  
  # Tests directory  
  tests_dir: "tests"
  
  # Claude Code is the default executor - only skip for trivial tasks
  default_executor: "claude_code"
  
  # Model selection for multi-agent reviews
  # Principle: Use latest generation model available, don't hardcode specific versions
  # Examples: "gpt-4.1-mini" -> use latest GPT, "claude-3" -> use latest Claude
  review_model: "latest_available"

  # Multi-model review configuration
  # Reviews are ON by default to catch issues in AI-generated code
  reviews:
    enabled: true
    on_by_default: true  # Reviews run automatically in REVIEW phase

    # Execution method: auto | cli | api | github-actions
    # - cli: Codex CLI + Gemini CLI (full repo access, best experience)
    # - api: OpenRouter API (context injection, works in Claude Code Web)
    # - github-actions: Triggered on PR (requires setup-reviews)
    method: auto

    # Review types and their models
    # Security + Quality use Codex (code-specialized)
    # Consistency + Holistic use Gemini (1M context for codebase understanding)
    types:
      security_review: codex
      quality_review: codex
      consistency_review: gemini
      holistic_review: gemini

    # Model versions - UPDATE THESE when new models are released
    # CLI models are used when running Codex/Gemini CLIs directly
    # API models are used when routing through OpenRouter
    models:
      cli:
        codex: "gpt-5.1-codex-max"       # Latest Codex model
        gemini: "gemini-3-pro-preview"   # Latest Gemini model (preview)
      api:
        codex: "openai/gpt-5.1"          # OpenRouter model ID
        gemini: "google/gemini-3-pro-preview"  # OpenRouter model ID

    # GitHub Actions configuration
    github_actions:
      required_for_merge: true  # Block PR merge if reviews fail

    # Fallback when preferred method unavailable
    fallback_to_api: true

phases:
  # ===========================================================================
  # PHASE 0: SETUP (implicit, run before workflow starts)
