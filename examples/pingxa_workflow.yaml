        description: |
          Check if docs/SPEC.md exists from a prior /spec session.

          If YES: Use it as the source of truth. The spec contains:
          - Validated outcome and success criteria
          - Approved user journey
          - Approved design artifact
          - Edge cases and acceptance criteria

          Skip clarifying_questions and proceed to plan generation.

          If NO: Continue with clarifying_questions to understand requirements.
          Consider running /spec first for complex features.

          If no spec exists, ask clarifying questions before planning:
          - What does the issue look like? Is this a regression?
          - What's the expected behavior?
          - Which areas are affected?
          - What does success look like?

          For complex features, recommend: "Consider running /spec first
