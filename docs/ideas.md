add a design phase

merge - including merging to a branch and rerunning all tests

do we create a PRD in a similar format to Thallow with screenshots for human review. what is best practice 

ultimately tool will need a front end for settings, document review and UI/UX review. Can I plug it in to vc code or something?

currently one shots everything. may makes sense to chunky it linked to context 

do we need to maintain a north star and perhaps updated PRD for context?

learnings need to have recommendations which are then implemented.
