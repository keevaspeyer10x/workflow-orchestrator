# Test Cases: WF-030 Phase 4 Documentation Update

## No New Tests Required

This is a documentation-only change (updating ROADMAP.md). No code changes are being made.

## Existing Test Coverage

The worktree functionality is already tested:
- `tests/test_worktree_manager.py` - Unit tests for WorktreeManager
- Session-start hook tested manually

## Verification

After ROADMAP.md update:
1. Verify checkboxes are correctly marked `[x]`
2. Verify status shows "COMPLETED"
3. No functional testing needed
